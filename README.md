# Band-website
This is a website made for a favourite band of mine - The Wrecks. It has three pages - a home , an about and a store. The home and about pages was built using simple HTML and CSS. The store page uses vanilla JavaScript to provide an interactive shopping interface to buy the band's albums and/or merch.
